# High Frequency Indicators Dashboard

This GitHub repo hosts the dashboard of high frequency indicators used by the Department of Finance Economics division. To assess economic activity in real-time, the Department has compiled a set of 
alternative, ‘ultra-high’ frequency data for different sectors of the economy. This dashboard was developed as an internal tool to bring together some of theses indicators during the pandemic.

As the economy recovers and society re-opens the dashboard aims to be a useful tool for tracking aspects of Ireland’s economic performance. These indicators provide a snapshot of trends and directions of travel and shouldn’t be used as substitutes for the official economic statistics published by the CSO.


## Why are some of the statistics here different than the Department of Health GeoHive Covid data hub?


The Department of Health GeoHive Covid data hub and the HPSC should be considered the authoritative sources of data on Covid-19 in Ireland. Some of the statistics here may vary because they’ve been sourced from the cross country Our World in Data dataset. This means there may be delays or small discrepancies between the two datasets and some of the calculations used.



## What are the sources for this data? Can I download it?


The sources for each of the raw datasets used in this chart are listed below the relevant charts.



## How is the mobility data collected?

Mobility data is collected by Google, using anonymised aggregated location information from users of its services. For more information on how this data is collected see [here](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/)

## How did you pick the countries to appear in the charts?

The countries that appear in these charts were chosen to provide a high level overview and comparison of the experience of major trading partners and neighboring countries, particularly in the European Union. In some instances all member states are included whereas in others for clarity a smaller selection of countries including non-EU countries like the UK and US are included.
